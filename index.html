					My name is Lucas Howard, and I am currently a junior at the Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics at the University of New Hampshire. I’m pursuing a degree in business finance, with a strong interest in investment strategy, corporate finance, and financial planning. I’m excited about opportunities to expand my knowledge, connect with professionals in the field, and apply my skills to real-world financial challenges.

					<p>The field of business finance is essential because it drives decision-making at every level of an organization, from startups to global corporations. Financial expertise ensures the effective allocation of resources, fuels innovation, and contributes to sustainable economic growth. I chose to pursue this field because I enjoy analyzing complex data, solving financial challenges, and helping organizations achieve their goals. I decided to attend the University of New Hampshire because of the exceptional reputation of the Paul College, its strong connections to the business community, and the opportunities it provides for hands-on learning and professional development. The supportive environment and focus on experiential education made UNH the perfect place to prepare for a successful career in finance.
